Provides a vastly more customizable work tab. 

# Important
**Requires HugsLib**
This mod requires HugsLib to be loaded before it, or it will not function.

**BETA release**
This should be considered a beta release. The basic functionality is confirmed to work, but there may be more elusive bugs still to be caught.


# Features
Various usability extentions to the 'vanilla' work tab; sorting by columns, toggling/changing priorities for entire columns at once, and creating presets. 

An extra detailed 'Dwarf Therapist' mode, that allows you to set priorities for the individual tasks within each job. 

Finally, a time scheduler to set priorities for a given time slot only - allows you to designate a cleaning hour, or have your cook prepare meals right before dinner, etc. etc. 


# Notes
With great power comes great responsibility. The default priorities of tasks within a job is set for a good reason; it's a sensible default. Changing these can lead to deadlock situations, so use the detailed tab at your own risk! 

Finally, there will never be an 'autolabor' mode where a mod sets priorities for you. Due to the way the AI is handled (e.g. pawns actively look for work, instead of there being a 'bulletin board' of jobs that need doing), it's not feasible to get the complete list of work that needs doing that would be needed to make this a reality, without extreme overhead and loads of special excpetion coding.
